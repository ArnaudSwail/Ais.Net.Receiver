# Ais.Net.Receiver

A simple .NET AIS Receiver for capturing the Norwegian Coastal Administration's marine Automatic Identification System (AIS) [AIVDM/AIVDO](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/AIVDM.html) NMEA message network data (available under [Norwegian license for public data (NLOD)](https://data.norge.no/nlod/en/2.0)) and persisting in Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.

The [Norwegian Costal Administration provide a TCP endpoint](https://ais.kystverket.no/) (`153.44.253.27:5631`) for broadcasting their raw AIS AIVDM/AIVDO sentences, captured by over 50 base stations, and covers the area 40-60 nautical miles from the Norwegian coastline.

This project contains a .NET Core console application that will reliably ingest the TCP stream, batch the AIVDM/AIVDO sentences and write them to Azure Blob Storage using the [Append Blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/append-block) feature, to create timestamped hour-long rolling logs.

## To Run
